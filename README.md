This package contains tools to analyse the output files produced by the cosmological hydrodynamic code AREPO

Currently, the package contains functionalities for obtaining the mass functions (dark matter haloes as well as galaxies), dark matter  correlation functions, and an ID based tracing of histories of particles across the available snapshots.

'arepo_package.py' contains all the required functions

'example_codes.ipynb' is an interactive notebook which contains some example code snippets to use the functions within 'arepo_package.py'  to generate quantities and plot them.
